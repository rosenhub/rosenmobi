            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>For almost a decade, Josh worked at this prestigious Chicago-based law firm. As the Director of Technology, he was required to support a legal team of less than twenty attorneys and personally involved in over $2 Billion in verdicts and settlements.</p>
                <p>Designing and maintaining their website in 1999 was no easy feat! Eventually, completely custom, database-driven applications were created by Josh to support the firm.</p>
                <p>Most cases got the VIP treatment, and that went for the trial exhibits as well. Josh created dozens of interactive presentations showcasing highly detailed 3D-animations and virtual recreations.</p>
